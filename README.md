# Power of a Hypothesis Test
Given the following hypotheses:

- $H_0 : \mu = \mu_0$

- $H_1 : \mu > \mu_0$

The code visualizes the power of a test, for a variety of alternative parameters, using both the area under the alternative hypothesis' curve (and right of the critical value) and the power function.

The top graph represents the first method; the bottom graph represents the second method:

### Note
While this code uses a normal with mean 0, variance 1.5, there is no reason why another distribution and/or parameter could not be used instead.

# Power Function for a Variety of n
Same hypotheses as above.
